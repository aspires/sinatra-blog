Some small things to do:
* Change the folder structure.
  (app/models/* -> app/models.rb; app/controllers/* -> app/controllers.rb ???)
* Move create_db.rb into a Rakefile.
* Take a look Sinatra Starter Kit (http://github.com/mikker/sinatra_starter_kit)
  and steal some ideas (directory structure, config/application.[rb|ru], rake..)
* Take a look at Wink, a blogging engine in Ruby using Rack, Sinatra, and
  DataMapper, by Ryan Tomayko. (http://github.com/rtomayko/wink)
* Merge changes made by a-priori on GitHub.

Some other important things missing:
* Authentication
* Comments
* Tagging
* Search
* Feeds
* A goal for this project
